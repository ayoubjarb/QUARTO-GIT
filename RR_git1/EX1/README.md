# Exercise 0: terminal (go down for more)

Open up the terminal
 Pick a space for your reproducible research materials and navigate there
 E.g. you can use cd <pathname> for navigation or do “Git Bash here” in Windows.

# Exercise 1: creating a repository (go down for more)
In your RR_git1 directory, initiate a git repository named EX1
(hint: you can either initiate it with that name, or create folder named EX1, enter it, and initiate the repository inside)

git init EX1

cd EX1
