## Synopsis

### Setting

The story of *Attack on Titan* centers on a civilization within three circular walls. Local knowledge portrays it as the last vestige of human civilization. Inhabitants, known as Eldians, believe that humanity faced near extinction due to the emergence of Titans, humanoid giants that prey on humans. The remnants of humanity retreated behind three concentric walls, enjoying a century of relative peace. Venturing outside the walls is discouraged. To combat Titans, the military employs Vertical Maneuvering Equipment (VME), enabling mobility in three dimensions. Swords and Thunder Spears made of ultrahard steel are used in conjunction.

Titans are classified into Pure Titans and Abnormal Titans, with the Nine Titans being the most powerful. Titan Shifters, like the Attack, Colossal, and Armored Titans, can transform between human and Titan form. These Titans can harden body parts and possess specialized abilities.

The Survey Corps aims to reclaim Wall Maria and unveil secrets. Battles with sentient Titans, political unrest, and revelations about Eldians' history unfold. The Rumbling, a genocidal event involving Wall Titans, triggers a global conflict. Eren's plan to spare humanity prompts major confrontations.
